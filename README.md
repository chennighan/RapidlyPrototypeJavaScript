# RapidlyPrototypeJavaScript
The objective of this course is to show you how you can rapidly prototype your JavaScript so that you can accomplish a few things: 

 - Become more efficient when you receive feature requests via rapidly prototyping your JavaScript code.
 - Gain a better understanding of feature planning and realizing prototyping a feature is often better than just adding the JavaScript directly to your project (of course there are scenarios where this is unavoidable)

Even with a deep understanding of JavaScript you can fall into the trap of over-complicating a feature, whereas if you prototype the feature to the specifications given, you take out a level of complexity that you often don't need.
